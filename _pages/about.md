I am Quantitative Research Director at QRT.

Before joining QRT I was an academic and most recently a stats prof at Oxford. 
My academic research focuses on the analysis of random processes and objects, especially those arising from algorithms used in computational statistics and machine learning. I have worked extensively on the theory and methodology of sampling methods, especially Markov Chain Monte Carlo. I have also worked on random walks on lattices and groups.
