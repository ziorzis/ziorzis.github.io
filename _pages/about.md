I'm a Professsor of Statistics in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford.

I work in the intersection of probability and statistics to analyse random processes and objects, especially those arising from algorithms used in computational statistics and machine learning. I have worked extensively on the theory and methodology of sampling methods, especially Markov Chain Monte Carlo. I have also worked on random walks on lattices and groups.
At the moment I am particularly interested in the interplay between sampling, optimal transport and machine learning.
