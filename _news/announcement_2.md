New preprint out with I. Azangulov and J. Rousseau, on the convergence of denoising diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. The paper can be found here. We show that diffusion models achieve rates for score learning and sampling(in KL) independent of the ambient dimension, showing that they adapt to the underlying manifold structure.
