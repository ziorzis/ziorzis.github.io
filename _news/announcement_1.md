Our preprint <a href="{{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}">Linear Convergence of Diffusion Models Under the Manifold Hypothesis</a> is out. In the context of ImageNet, our work suggests using ~100 steps (intrinsic dim) for effective sampling, compared to the existing state-of-the-art bounds, which recommend ~150k steps (ambient dim).
