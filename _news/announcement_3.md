New preprint out with Alex Goyal and Nikolas Kantas (Imperial), on the convergence of Gibbs samplers beyond the log-concave setting. 
In particular we establish bounds on the conductance for the systematic-scan and random-scan Gibbs samplers when the target distribution satisfies a Poincare or log-Sobolev inequality and possesses sufficiently regular conditional distributions. You can find it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22258).
